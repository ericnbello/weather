# Weather App

## Overview

The Weather App is a web application designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information. Built with Django, Python, and integrated with the OpenWeather API, this app offers a streamlined weather experience. Additionally, it incorporates the Google Maps API to display a radar map for visual weather insights.

## Technologies Used

### Django Framework

The project is developed using Django, a versatile web framework that simplifies web application development. Leveraging Django's capabilities, we created a seamless user interface for accessing weather data.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS was employed for styling the application, allowing for rapid UI development. The utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS ensured an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design.

### Python

Python serves as the primary programming language for server-side logic and data processing. Its simplicity and robustness facilitated efficient development and seamless integration of various APIs.

### OpenWeather API

The Weather App relies on the OpenWeather API to provide reliable and real-time weather data. This API supplies accurate information about current conditions, forecasts, and more, ensuring users receive up-to-date weather updates.

### JavaScript

JavaScript enhances user interactivity on the client-side, enabling dynamic content updates without the need for page refreshes. This ensures a fluid and responsive user experience.

### Google Maps API

The Google Maps API is integrated to present a radar map, providing users with a visual representation of weather patterns and conditions in their area. This feature adds a valuable dimension to the app's functionality.
